josshhz11: i want to prompt llama3.2 that i initialized to refine the questions in the general_question_bank, to be more conversational, upbeat, and engaging to mental health patients. we are building an ai telegram bot that checks in with discharged mental health patients on behalf of mental health doctors and nurses. we will initiate conversations with mental health patients every few days (maybe every day). we want to train the model to predict sentiment scores of positive or negative answers on a scale of maybe 1 to 100? on the overall well-being of the patient, and we want to track a cumulative score which will give context to each session of questions where a session score will be computed as well.

also, depending on the answers to the questions, more specific questions can be tailored to the responses and user based on his past responses and cumulative score which will be stored in a database. this specific questions can be generated by the GenAI NLP tool and model.

right now i'm trying to use a GenAI model like Llama3.2 to generate and flesh out my general_question_bank, and generate 50 sample responses to each open-ended question. i will then manually label the responses to the question.

we will then feed this dataset into a model like BERT or even an LLM for training on sentiment analysis prediction.

so right now back to the part im working on, i want to prompt llama3.2 that i initialized to refine the questions in the general_question_bank, to be more conversational, upbeat, and engaging to mental health patients. as for the output from the LLM, how do i parse it and into a a new updated question bank list? do i save the contents to a txt? then parse it into a list again through separators.

please generate an in-depth prompt to the model with the question bank as input and to generate only the refined questions as per the specifications above. you can provide the model with more context.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you create a more comprehensive prompt for refining the questions and handling the output. Here's how we can modify your code:

```python
def get_refined_questions(question_bank):
    prompt = """You are an empathetic mental health professional who specializes in patient engagement and follow-up care. 
    
Task: Rewrite each question to be more conversational, empathetic, and engaging for mental health patients who have been discharged from care.

Guidelines:
- Make questions warm and supportive
- Use casual, friendly language
- Avoid clinical or formal tone
- Include gentle encouragement
- Make questions open-ended to encourage dialogue
- Maintain a positive, upbeat tone while being sensitive
- Each response should be a single question
- Keep the core meaning of each original question

Input Questions:
{questions}

Format your response as a numbered list with ONLY the refined questions, one per line, starting with 1.
Do not include any other text or explanations."""

    # Convert question bank to numbered string format
    questions_str = "\n".join([f"{i+1}. {q}" for i, q in enumerate(question_bank)])
    
    chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template=prompt)
    chain = chat_prompt | model
    
    # Get response from model
    response = chain.invoke({"questions": questions_str})
    
    # Parse the response into a list of questions
    refined_questions = []
    for line in response.content.split('\n'):
        # Skip empty lines and extract questions
        if line.strip() and any(char.isdigit() for char in line):
            # Remove numbering and whitespace
            question = line.split('.', 1)[1].strip()
            refined_questions.append(question)
            
    return refined_questions

# Use the function
refined_question_bank = get_refined_questions(general_question_bank)

# Save to file (optional)
with open('refined_questions.txt', 'w') as f:
    for q in refined_question_bank:
        f.write(q + '\n')

# Print results
print("Original questions:")
for q in general_question_bank:
    print(f"- {q}")

print("\nRefined questions:")
for q in refined_question_bank:
    print(f"- {q}")
```

This code:
1. Creates a detailed prompt that provides context and guidelines
2. Formats the input questions as a numbered list
3. Uses the LangChain chat prompt template
4. Parses the response into a clean list of questions
5. Optionally saves to a file
6. Prints both original and refined questions for comparison

Example of how the refined questions might look:
- "Hey! Have you managed to get any exercise or movement in today? Even a short walk counts! üòä"
- "I'd love to hear about your day - did you get a chance to step outside at all?"
- "Just checking in about your medications - how's that routine going for you?"
- "How did you sleep last night? Feel free to tell me about your rest üí§"

The prompt is structured to:
- Give clear context about the purpose
- Provide specific guidelines for tone and style
- Request a specific output format for easy parsing
- Maintain the core meaning while making questions more engaging

You can adjust the prompt or parsing logic based on the specific output format you prefer from the model.

i'm getting this error, can you fix it and also print like checkpoints i.e. generating questions, finished generating, etc.? 

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you fix the error and add progress checkpoints. The error occurs because the response from the LangChain chain is already a string, not an object with a content attribute.

Key changes made:
1. Removed `.content` from `response.content.split('\n')` as the response is already a string
2. Added progress checkpoints with emoji indicators
3. Added file saving functionality
4. Improved console output formatting
5. Added error handling and progress tracking

The code will now show clear progress indicators as it:
1. Starts the refinement process
2. Formats the input questions
3. Generates refined questions using the LLM
4. Parses the results
5. Saves the output
6. Displays the before/after comparison

Try running this updated version - it should work without the AttributeError and provide better visibility into the process.

josshhz11: def generate_responses():

can you create this function that generates 50 samples for each question, and store each the corresponding questions and responses in a pandas dataframe, before converting it to a csv file?

in this function, it should read the refined_questions.txt file, parse the questions into a list, and the questions are in this format separated by a space:
How was your day today - were there any moments that felt like a highlight for you?
Did anything exciting or comforting happen outside of your home today?
Are you finding it easy to stick to your medication routine, and if not, what's been the biggest challenge?
What was your bedtime like last night - did you get some good rest?
How would you rate your overall mood today on a scale from 1 to 10 - is there anything that might have changed that score?
Did any of your family or friends do or say something special for you today that made you feel seen or loved?
Is there something you've been looking forward to doing all day, and if so, did you get a chance to do it?

or should we set up a sqlite3 database where we can create a relational schema, because i feel like the question column in the df/csv file will be repeated a lot.

so perhaps we have 2 tables, where the main table will have the question_id which is a foreign key from the other table questions, and it will also contain the responses and perhaps a response_id as the primary key. the other table will be questions: with question_id and the corresponding 7 questions.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you create the `generate_responses` function with a SQLite database approach, which is more efficient for this use case.

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

def generate_responses():
    print("üöÄ Starting response generation process...")
    
    # Read refined questions from file
    print("üìñ Reading refined questions from file...")
    with open('refined_questions.txt', 'r') as f:

    # Initialize SQLite database

    cursor = conn.cursor()

    )''')
    
    # Insert questions
    print("üìù Inserting questions into database...")

    chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template=response_prompt)
    chain = chat_prompt | model
    
    # Generate 50 responses for each question
    for question_id, question in enumerate(questions, 1):
        print(f"\nüí≠ Generating responses for question {question_id}/{len(questions)}")

    questions_df.to_csv('questions.csv', index=False)
    
    # Export responses
    responses_df = pd.read_sql_query("""
        SELECT r.response_id, q.question_text, r.response_text 
        FROM responses r 
        JOIN questions q ON r.question_id = q.question_id

    print("   - questions.csv")
    print("   - responses.csv")

```

Key features of this implementation:

1. **Database Structure**:
   - `questions` table: `question_id`, `question_text`
   - `responses` table: `response_id`, `question_id`, `response_text`

2. **Process Flow**:
   - Reads refined questions from file
   - Sets up SQLite database
   - Creates tables with proper relationships
   - Generates 50 responses per question using LLM
   - Exports data to both SQLite and CSV formats

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Shows progress indicators
   - Provides status updates
   - Reports final statistics

To use this function, simply call:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    generate_responses()
```

The function will:
- Create a SQLite database (`mental_health_data.db`)
- Generate CSV exports for easy data analysis
- Show progress in real-time
- Maintain data relationships
- Provide both structured (SQL) and flat (CSV) data formats

The SQLite approach offers several advantages:
- Efficient storage (no question repetition)
- Data integrity through relationships
- Easy querying capabilities
- Flexible export options
- Scalability for future features

josshhz11: i've separated the initialize_db() into a separate function. can you help me check if it is correct?

moreover, given the current dataset, how would i manually label the data with a sentiment score of 1-100? i would need to label each and every data point, and i don't think it's very feasible to do so using SQL? or is it? please correct me if i'm wrong. or should it be done on the csv instead?

GitHub Copilot: Let's break this down into two parts:

### 1. Database Initialization Function
Your `initialize_db()` function looks correct, but we should add a few improvements:

```python
def initialize_db():
    try:
        print("üóÑÔ∏è Setting up SQLite database...")
        conn = sqlite3.connect('mental_health_data.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        # Drop existing tables if needed
        cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS responses')
        cursor.execute('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS questions')

        # Create tables
        cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS questions (
            question_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            question_text TEXT NOT NULL
        )''')
        
        cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS responses (
            response_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            question_id INTEGER,
            response_text TEXT NOT NULL,
            sentiment_score INTEGER DEFAULT NULL,
            FOREIGN KEY (question_id) REFERENCES questions (question_id)
        )''')

        conn.commit()
        conn.close()
        print("‚úÖ Database setup complete!")
        return True
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Database error: {e}")
        return False
```

### 2. Sentiment Labeling Strategy

For manual sentiment labeling, I recommend the following approach:

1. **Create a Simple Labeling Tool**:
```python
def label_sentiments():
    # Read the responses CSV
    df = pd.read_csv('responses.csv')
    
    # Create a copy for labeled data
    labeled_df = df.copy()
    labeled_df['sentiment_score'] = None
    
    print("üè∑Ô∏è Starting sentiment labeling process...")
    print("Enter a score from 1-100 for each response")
    print("(1: Very Negative, 50: Neutral, 100: Very Positive)")
    print("Type 'q' to save and quit\n")
    
    try:
        for idx, row in df.iterrows():
            # Clear screen for Windows
            os.system('cls')
            
            print(f"Progress: {idx + 1}/{len(df)} responses")
            print(f"\nQuestion: {row['question_text']}")
            print(f"Response: {row['response_text']}")
            
            while True:
                score = input("\nEnter sentiment score (1-100) or 'q' to quit: ")
                if score.lower() == 'q':
                    raise KeyboardInterrupt
                try:
                    score = int(score)
                    if 1 <= score <= 100:
                        labeled_df.at[idx, 'sentiment_score'] = score
                        break
                    else:
                        print("Please enter a number between 1 and 100")
                except ValueError:
                    print("Please enter a valid number")
                    
            # Save progress every 10 responses
            if (idx + 1) % 10 == 0:
                labeled_df.to_csv('labeled_responses.csv', index=False)
                print("\nProgress saved! ‚úÖ")
                
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\n\nLabeling interrupted. Saving progress...")
    
    # Save final results
    labeled_df.to_csv('labeled_responses.csv', index=False)
    
    # Update database with new labels
    conn = sqlite3.connect('mental_health_data.db')
    for idx, row in labeled_df.iterrows():
        if pd.notna(row['sentiment_score']):
            conn.execute('''
                UPDATE responses 
                SET sentiment_score = ? 
                WHERE response_id = ?
            ''', (int(row['sentiment_score']), row['response_id']))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    
    print("\n‚úÖ Labeling process completed and saved!")
```

To use this system:

1. First run your data generation:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    generate_refined_questions()
    generate_responses()
    label_sentiments()
```

Key features of this approach:
- Shows one response at a time for focused labeling
- Saves progress automatically every 10 responses
- Allows quitting and resuming later
- Updates both CSV and database
- Provides clear progress indicators
- Input validation for scores

Why this hybrid approach (CSV + Database) works well:
1. CSV is easier for:
   - Manual inspection
   - Data cleaning
   - Importing into other tools
   - Version control
2. Database is better for:
   - Data relationships
   - Query performance
   - Data integrity
   - Future application integration

You can modify the labeling intervals, score range, or add additional features like:
- Batch labeling similar responses
- Adding confidence scores
- Adding notes/comments
- Multiple labeler support
- Inter-rater reliability calculations

josshhz11: some questions i have, can we use scores that are between 100 and 1? not just these 3 checkpoints mentioned here:

print("Enter a score from 1-100 for each response")
    print("(1: Very Negative, 50: Neutral, 100: Very Positive)")

also can we create a query_db() function? that allows me to query the database to see the responses for each question.

GitHub Copilot: Let me help with both requests:

1. For the sentiment scoring, we can update the instructions to be more granular. Here's the modified part of the `label_sentiments()` function:

```python
def label_sentiments():
    # ...existing code...
    print("üè∑Ô∏è Starting sentiment labeling process...")
    print("Enter a score from 1-100 for each response:")
    print("Guidelines:")
    print("‚Ä¢ 1-20:   Very negative/concerning responses")
    print("‚Ä¢ 21-40:  Moderately negative responses")
    print("‚Ä¢ 41-60:  Neutral responses")
    print("‚Ä¢ 61-80:  Moderately positive responses")
    print("‚Ä¢ 81-100: Very positive/encouraging responses")
    print("\nUse any number within these ranges for fine-grained scoring")
    print("Type 'q' to save and quit\n")
```

2. Here's a new `query_db()` function that allows flexible querying of the database:

```python
def query_db():
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect('mental_health_data.db')
        
        while True:
            print("\nüìä Database Query Options:")
            print("1. View all questions")
            print("2. View responses for a specific question")
            print("3. View responses by sentiment range")
            print("4. View summary statistics")
            print("5. Exit")
            
            choice = input("\nEnter your choice (1-5): ")
            
            if choice == '1':
                questions_df = pd.read_sql_query(
                    "SELECT question_id, question_text FROM questions", conn)

You can use it by calling `query_db()` in your main function or directly running the script.

josshhz11: print("5. Input custom SQL query")

can you help me create this section where it takes users sql query and uses try: except exception in case the query does not work, etc.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you add the custom SQL query option. Here's how to modify the relevant section in your `query_db()` function:

```python
# Replace the 'case '5':' section in your query_db() function
                case '5':
                    print("\nüìù Custom SQL Query")
                    print("Available tables: 'questions' and 'responses'")
                    print("Example: SELECT * FROM questions WHERE question_id = 1")
                    
                    try:

                            print("‚ùå Error: Query must start with SELECT")
                            continue
                        
                        # Execute query and fetch results
                        result_df = pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
                        
                        if result_df.empty:
                            print("\nNo results found.")

                            print(f"Found {len(result_df)} rows")
                            print("\nColumns:", ", ".join(result_df.columns))
                            print("\nResults:")
                            pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
                            pd.set_option('display.width', None)
                            print(result_df.to_string())
                            
                            # Option to save results
                            save = input("\nWould you like to save these results to CSV? (y/n): ")
                            if save.lower() == 'y':
                                filename = f"custom_query_results_{int(time.time())}.csv"
                                result_df.to_csv(filename, index=False)
                                print(f"‚úÖ Results saved to {filename}")
                                
                    except pd.io.sql.DatabaseError as e:
                        print(f"‚ùå SQL Error: {str(e)}")
                    except Exception as e:
                        print(f"‚ùå Unexpected error: {str(e)}")
```

This implementation:

1. **Safety Features**:
   - Blocks non-SELECT queries
   - Prevents potentially dangerous operations

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Catches SQL syntax errors
   - Handles general exceptions
   - Provides user-friendly error messages

3. **Output Features**:
   - Shows number of rows returned
   - Lists available columns
   - Displays formatted results
   - Option to save to CSV

4. **Usage Examples**:
```sql
-- Example queries users can try:
SELECT * FROM questions;
SELECT response_text, sentiment_score FROM responses WHERE sentiment_score > 80;
SELECT q.question_text, COUNT(r.response_id) as response_count 
FROM questions q 
LEFT JOIN responses r ON q.question_id = r.question_id 
GROUP BY q.question_text;
```

To use, select option 5 from the query menu and enter your SQL query. The results will be displayed in a formatted table, and you'll have the option to save them to a CSV file.

josshhz11: i was wondering if i put this entire code base on a github repository and i run the commands it will create a mental_health_data.db that will be able to be accessed to all? but how would running a llama3.2 model differ since its not technically 100% local now.

GitHub Copilot: Let me explain how to handle this distributed setup:

### Database Sharing
The mental_health_data.db SQLite database can be:
1. **Git tracked** - Include in repository for sharing labeled data
2. **Git ignored** - Each user generates their own dataset locally

### Recommended Approach

```plaintext
your-repo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore           # Ignore local model files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # Dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generate_dataset.py  # Main code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Setup instructions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/               # Data directory
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitkeep        # Empty file to track directory
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ schema.sql      # Database schema
```

### 1. Create a `.gitignore`:
```gitignore
*.db
model/
__pycache__/
*.csv
refined_questions.txt
labeled_responses.txt
```

### 2. Add a `requirements.txt`:
```text
langchain
langchain-ollama
pandas
streamlit
```

### 3. Update the README.md:
````markdown
# Mental Health Response Generator

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Install Ollama and download Llama 3.2:
```bash
# Windows WSL or Linux/Mac
curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
ollama pull llama3.2
```

3. Run the generator:
```bash
python generate_dataset.py
```

## Database
- Database is generated locally
- Share labeled datasets via CSV exports
- Schema available in `data/schema.sql`
````

### 4. Modify code to use configurable paths:
```python
# Add at top of file
from pathlib import Path

# Create data directory constant
DATA_DIR = Path("data")
DATA_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

# Update database path
DB_PATH = DATA_DIR / "mental_health_data.db"

# Modify database connections to use DB_PATH
conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH)
```

### Handling Llama 3.2
1. **Local Setup**: Each user needs to:
   - Install Ollama locally
   - Pull the Llama 3.2 model
   - Run Ollama server locally

2. **Alternative Cloud Setup**:
```python
# Configure model based on environment
if os.getenv("USE_CLOUD_MODEL"):
    model = CloudLLM(api_key="...")  # Your cloud LLM service
else:
    model = OllamaLLM(model="llama3.2")
```

### Benefits of this approach:
- Database schema version controlled
- Each user generates data locally
- Labeled data can be shared via CSV exports
- Clear setup instructions
- Flexible between local and cloud LLM

### Sharing Labeled Data
Users can:
1. Generate responses locally
2. Label sentiments
3. Export to CSV
4. Share CSV files in repository
5. Others can import these labeled datasets

Would you like me to provide more specific code for any of these aspects?

josshhz11: i have some questions regarding this potential migration:
1. cloud llm won't be free right? it requires something like openai's api key?
2. once i'm done generating these sample responses, i can push this entire repository up onto a github repository, and the mental_health_data.db will contain all the questions and responses as they are locally? and my teammates can access them.
3. so since i already have llama3.2 locally, when i run this using github desktop, i will be able to just run python generate_dataset.py and that will be it? it will update the database accordingly and when i push and commit to github it will be reflected?
4. generating the dataset is taking a while so i'm wondering if it's possible to activate my AMD Radeon Graphics GPU to do the model training and even using the local LLM on.

GitHub Copilot: Let me address each of your questions:

1. **Cloud LLM Costs**
- Yes, cloud LLMs like OpenAI's GPT models require paid API keys
- Typical costs:
  - GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens
  - GPT-4: ~$0.03-0.06 per 1K tokens
- Alternatives:
  - Azure OpenAI Service (enterprise)
  - Anthropic Claude (similar pricing)
  - Cohere (similar pricing)

2. **Database Version Control**
- Not recommended to push `.db` files directly to GitHub
- Better approach:

```python
import sqlite3
import json

def export_database():
    conn = sqlite3.connect('mental_health_data.db')
    
    # Export questions
    questions = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM questions", conn)
    questions.to_json('data/questions.json', orient='records')
    
    # Export responses with labels
    responses = pd.read_sql_query("""
        SELECT r.*, q.question_text 
        FROM responses r 
        JOIN questions q ON r.question_id = q.question_id
    """, conn)
    responses.to_json('data/responses.json', orient='records')
    
    conn.close()
```

```python
def import_database():
    # Create fresh DB
    initialize_db()
    conn = sqlite3.connect('mental_health_data.db')
    
    # Import questions
    questions = pd.read_json('data/questions.json')
    questions.to_sql('questions', conn, if_exists='append', index=False)
    
    # Import responses
    responses = pd.read_json('data/responses.json')
    responses.to_sql('responses', conn, if_exists='append', index=False)
    
    conn.close()
```

3. **Local Llama Setup**
- You'll need to update the README with setup instructions:

````markdown
## Setup Instructions

1. Install Ollama:
```bash
# Windows (WSL2)
curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Or download from: https://ollama.ai/download
```

2. Pull Llama model:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
```

3. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Import existing dataset:
```bash
python import_data.py
```
````

4. **GPU Acceleration**
- Llama through Ollama already supports GPU acceleration
- For AMD GPU, you'll need ROCm support:

```python
import os

# Configure GPU settings
os.environ["HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION"] = "10.3.0"  # For AMD GPUs
model = OllamaLLM(
    model="llama3.2",
    gpu_layers=35  # Adjust based on your GPU memory
)
```

**Recommended Project Structure:**
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore          # Ignore .db files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ questions.json  # Tracked question data
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ responses.json  # Tracked response data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generate_dataset.py # Main script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ export_data.py     # Database ‚Üí JSON
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ import_data.py     # JSON ‚Üí Database
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt   # Dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md         # Setup instructions
```

**.gitignore:**
```gitignore
*.db
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.csv
refined_questions.txt
labeled_responses.txt
```

This setup allows:
- Version control of data through JSON
- Easy sharing between team members
- GPU acceleration where available
- Clear setup instructions
- Reproducible environment

Would you like me to provide more detailed code for any of these components?

josshhz11: import os

# Configure GPU settings
os.environ["HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION"] = "10.3.0"  # For AMD GPUs
model = OllamaLLM(
    model="llama3.2",
    gpu_layers=35  # Adjust based on your GPU memory
)

can you elaborate in detail on the whole setup and configuration of this? and how to check if it works? and it is being used?

GitHub Copilot: # Setting up GPU Acceleration for Llama with Ollama

Here's a detailed guide for setting up GPU acceleration:

### 1. Check GPU Support
First, verify your AMD GPU is recognized:

```python
import torch
import platform
import os

def check_gpu_support():
    print(f"Platform: {platform.system()}")
    print(f"Python version: {platform.python_version()}")
    print(f"PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}")
    
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        print("\nCUDA Information:")
        print(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
        print(f"CUDA version: {torch.version.cuda}")
        print(f"GPU device: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
    else:
        print("\nNo CUDA GPU detected")
    
    # Check for ROCm (AMD)
    if hasattr(torch, 'hip') and torch.hip.is_available():
        print("\nROCm Information:")
        print("ROCm is available")
        print(f"Device count: {torch.hip.device_count()}")
    else:
        print("\nNo ROCm (AMD) GPU support detected")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_gpu_support()
```

### 2. Configure GPU Settings
Modify your main script:

```python
import os
import torch
from langchain_ollama import OllamaLLM

# AMD GPU Configuration
def configure_gpu():
    print("üîß Configuring GPU settings...")
    
    # Set AMD GPU environment variables
    os.environ["HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION"] = "10.3.0"
    os.environ["HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "0"  # Use first GPU
    
    # Initialize Ollama with GPU settings
    model = OllamaLLM(
        model="llama3.2",
        gpu_layers=35,  # Adjust based on your GPU memory
        num_gpu=1,      # Number of GPUs to use
        num_thread=8    # Number of CPU threads
    )
    
    return model

# Update your existing model initialization
try:
    model = configure_gpu()
    print("‚úÖ GPU configuration successful")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"‚ùå GPU configuration failed: {e}")
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è Falling back to CPU")
    model = OllamaLLM(model="llama3.2")
```

### 3. Monitor GPU Usage
Create a utility to monitor GPU usage:

```python
import psutil
import GPUtil
import time

def monitor_gpu_usage():
    print("üìä GPU Monitoring Started")
    print("-" * 50)
    
    try:
        while True:
            gpus = GPUtil.getGPUs()
            for gpu in gpus:
                print(f"\rGPU Load: {gpu.load*100:0.1f}% | Memory Use: {gpu.memoryUsed}MB / {gpu.memoryTotal}MB", end="")
            time.sleep(1)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\n\nMonitoring stopped")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    monitor_gpu_usage()
```

### 4. Test GPU Acceleration
Create a test script:

```python
from langchain_ollama import OllamaLLM
import time

def test_gpu_performance():
    # Initialize model with GPU
    model_gpu = OllamaLLM(
        model="llama3.2",

GitHub Copilot: # Setting up AMD GPU Support on Windows

For Windows, setting up AMD GPU support with PyTorch requires specific steps since ROCm is primarily designed for Linux. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Check GPU Model**
First, verify your AMD GPU model in Windows:
```batch
wmic path win32_VideoController get name
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
You'll need to install the specific PyTorch version that supports AMD GPUs on Windows:

```batch
# Remove existing PyTorch
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio

# Install AMD-compatible PyTorch
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.6
```

3. **Install AMD Software**
- Download and install the latest [AMD Radeon Software](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
- Install [Visual Studio 2019 C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

4. **Update GPU Check Script**
```python
import torch
import platform
import os
import subprocess

def get_gpu_info_windows():
    try:
        result = subprocess.check_output("wmic path win32_VideoController get name", shell=True).decode()
        return [line.strip() for line in result.split('\n') if line.strip() and 'name' not in line.lower()]
    except:
        return ["Unable to detect GPU"]

def check_gpu_support():
    print(f"Platform: {platform.system()}")
    print(f"Python version: {platform.python_version()}")
    print(f"PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}")
    
    print("\nDetected GPUs:")
    for gpu in get_gpu_info_windows():
        print(f"- {gpu}")
    
    print("\nPyTorch Device Information:")
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        print("CUDA is available")
        print(f"CUDA version: {torch.version.cuda}")
        print(f"GPU device: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
    elif hasattr(torch, 'hip') and torch.hip.is_available():
        print("ROCm (AMD) is available")
        print(f"Device count: {torch.hip.device_count()}")
        print(f"Current device: {torch.hip.current_device()}")
    else:
        print("No GPU acceleration detected")
        print("PyTorch device: CPU")
    
    # Print PyTorch device configuration
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() 
                         else "hip" if (hasattr(torch, 'hip') and torch.hip.is_available())
                         else "cpu")
    print(f"\nPyTorch will use device: {device}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_gpu_support()
```

5. **Test GPU Configuration with Ollama**
```python
from langchain_ollama import OllamaLLM
import time

def test_ollama_gpu():
    print("Testing Ollama GPU configuration...")
    
    # Configure Ollama with GPU support
    model = OllamaLLM(
        model="llama3.2",
        gpu_layers=35,
        num_ctx=2048,
        f16_kv=True  # Enable half-precision for better performance
    )
    
    test_prompt = "Write a short paragraph about AI."
    
    print("Running inference test...")
    start_time = time.time()
    response = model.invoke(test_prompt)
    end_time = time.time()
    
    print(f"\nInference time: {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds")
    print(f"Response length: {len(response)} characters")
    
    return response

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_ollama_gpu()
```

6. **Verify Ollama GPU Usage**
In Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
# Check if Ollama is using GPU
ollama run llama3.2 "Hello" --gpu
```

7. **Common Issues & Solutions**
- If PyTorch still shows CPU only:
  - Verify AMD driver version matches ROCm requirements
  - Try using an older PyTorch version (some versions have better AMD support)
  - Make sure Windows is up to date
- If Ollama doesn't detect GPU:
  - Check Windows GPU settings (Settings -> System -> Display -> Graphics settings)
  - Verify AMD Software is properly installed
  - Try running Ollama with administrative privileges

Would you like me to provide more specific troubleshooting steps based on your AMD GPU model?

josshhz11: # Remove existing PyTorch
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio

# Install AMD-compatible PyTorch
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.6

do i still run the above if my output is as following:
Name
AMD Radeon (TM) Graphics

GitHub Copilot: # Setting up PyTorch for AMD Radeon Graphics

Based on your GPU output showing "AMD Radeon (TM) Graphics", you'll need a different approach since ROCm support is limited on Windows. Here's what to do:

1. First, let's enhance the GPU detection script:

```python
import torch
import platform
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def get_detailed_gpu_info():
    try:
        # Get GPU information using Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line
        gpu_info = subprocess.check_output(
            "wmic path win32_VideoController get Name, AdapterRAM, DriverVersion",
            shell=True
        ).decode()
        return gpu_info.strip()
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error getting GPU info: {str(e)}"

def check_gpu_support():
    print("=== System Information ===")
    print(f"Platform: {platform.system()} {platform.release()}")
    print(f"Python version: {sys.version.split()[0]}")
    print(f"PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}")
    
    print("\n=== GPU Information ===")
    print(get_detailed_gpu_info())
    
    print("\n=== PyTorch Device Configuration ===")
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    print(f"PyTorch default device: {device}")
    
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        print(f"CUDA version: {torch.version.cuda}")
        print(f"GPU device: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
    else:
        print("CUDA not available - using CPU only")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_gpu_support()
```

2. For AMD Radeon Graphics on Windows, you should:

- **DO NOT** install the ROCm version as it won't work on Windows
- Instead, use the default PyTorch installation:

```batch
# Remove any existing PyTorch installation
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio -y

# Install the default PyTorch version
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

3. For Ollama configuration with AMD GPU:

```python
from langchain_ollama import OllamaLLM

# Configure Ollama for optimal performance
model = OllamaLLM(
    model="llama3.2",
    num_thread=8,  # Adjust based on your CPU cores
    num_gpu=1,
    f16_kv=True,   # Enable half-precision
    gpu_layers=35  # Adjust based on available memory
)
```

4. To verify Ollama is using your GPU:

```batch
# Check Ollama GPU usage
ollama run llama3.2 "Hello" --gpu
```

### Important Notes:
1. AMD GPUs on Windows primarily work through DirectML, not ROCm
2. The standard PyTorch installation is recommended for Windows
3. GPU acceleration for Ollama works separately from PyTorch's GPU support
4. Focus on Ollama's GPU configuration rather than PyTorch for your LLM tasks

Would you like me to provide a script to benchmark Ollama's performance with and without GPU acceleration?

josshhz11: hmm then later on if i wish to train my model on input and output data do i still use ollama? ive heard that we should use huggingface trainer to train our LLMs with pytorch

GitHub Copilot: # Training LLMs with Hugging Face vs Ollama

You're correct. Ollama is primarily for inference and deployment, while Hugging Face's Trainer is better suited for model training. Here's how to modify your setup:

1. First, let's add the required dependencies to your project:

```bash
# Install Hugging Face libraries
pip install transformers datasets evaluate accelerate
```

2. Create a new script for model training:

```python
import pandas as pd
from transformers import (
    AutoModelForSequenceClassification,
    AutoTokenizer,
    TrainingArguments,
    Trainer
)
from datasets import Dataset
import torch
import sqlite3

def prepare_dataset():
    # Load data from your SQLite database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('mental_health_data.db')
    df = pd.read_sql_query("""
        SELECT r.response_text, r.sentiment_score
        FROM responses r
        WHERE r.sentiment_score IS NOT NULL
    """, conn)
    conn.close()
    
    # Convert to HuggingFace Dataset
    dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(df)
    return dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.2)

def train_sentiment_model():
    # Load BERT model for sequence classification
    model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
        model_name, 
        num_labels=1  # Regression task
    )
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    
    # Prepare dataset
    dataset = prepare_dataset()
    
    def tokenize_function(examples):
        return tokenizer(
            examples["response_text"],
            padding="max_length",
            truncation=True,
            max_length=128
        )
    
    # Tokenize datasets
    tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
    
    # Training arguments
    training_args = TrainingArguments(
        output_dir="./results",
        num_train_epochs=3,
        per_device_train_batch_size=8,
        per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
        warmup_steps=500,
        weight_decay=0.01,
        logging_dir='./logs',
        logging_steps=10,
    )
    
    # Initialize Trainer
    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        args=training_args,
        train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
        eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["test"]
    )
    
    # Train model
    trainer.train()
    
    # Save model
    trainer.save_model("./sentiment_model")
    tokenizer.save_pretrained("./sentiment_model")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Check for GPU
    device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
    print(f"Using device: {device}")
    
    train_sentiment_model()
```

3. Update your GPU configuration script to check for AMD DirectML support:

```python
def check_gpu_support():
    # ...existing code...
    
    # Check for DirectML support
    try:
        import torch_directml
        print("\n=== DirectML Support (AMD GPU) ===")
        print("DirectML is available for AMD GPU acceleration")
        dml_device = torch_directml.device()
        print(f"DirectML device: {dml_device}")
    except ImportError:
        print("\nDirectML not installed. For AMD GPU support, install:")
        print("pip install torch-directml")
```

### Workflow:

1. Use Ollama for:
   - Initial data generation
   - Quick inference testing
   - Deployment

2. Use Hugging Face for:
   - Model fine-tuning
   - Training on your sentiment data
   - Production model development

Would you like me to provide additional code for model evaluation and inference using the trained model?

josshhz11: def check_gpu_support():
    # ...existing code...
    
    # Check for DirectML support
    try:
        import torch_directml
        print("\n=== DirectML Support (AMD GPU) ===")
        print("DirectML is available for AMD GPU acceleration")
        dml_device = torch_directml.device()
        print(f"DirectML device: {dml_device}")
    except ImportError:
        print("\nDirectML not installed. For AMD GPU support, install:")
        print("pip install torch-directml")

        where do i add this? can you show this in more detail?

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you modify the amd_gpu_configuration.py file to include DirectML support checking. Here's the complete updated file:

```python
import torch
import platform
import os
import subprocess
import sys

def get_detailed_gpu_info():
    try:
        # Get GPU information using Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line
        gpu_info = subprocess.check_output(
            "wmic path win32_VideoController get Name, AdapterRAM, DriverVersion",
            shell=True
        ).decode()
        return gpu_info.strip()
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error getting GPU info: {str(e)}"

def check_gpu_support():
    print("=== System Information ===")
    print(f"Platform: {platform.system()} {platform.release()}")
    print(f"Python version: {sys.version.split()[0]}")
    print(f"PyTorch version: {torch.__version__}")
    
    print("\n=== GPU Information ===")
    print(get_detailed_gpu_info())
    
    print("\n=== PyTorch Device Configuration ===")
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    print(f"PyTorch default device: {device}")
    
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        print(f"CUDA version: {torch.version.cuda}")
        print(f"GPU device: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0)}")
    else:
        print("CUDA not available - using CPU only")
    
    # Check for DirectML support
    try:
        import torch_directml
        print("\n=== DirectML Support (AMD GPU) ===")
        print("DirectML is available for AMD GPU acceleration")
        dml_device = torch_directml.device()
        print(f"DirectML device: {dml_device}")
    except ImportError:
        print("\n=== DirectML Support (AMD GPU) ===")
        print("DirectML not installed. For AMD GPU support, run:")
        print("pip install torch-directml")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_gpu_support()
```

To use this:

1. First install DirectML support:
```bash
pip install torch-directml
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python amd_gpu_configuration.py
```

The output should now include an additional section showing DirectML support status for your AMD GPU. If DirectML is successfully installed, you can then use it in your training scripts by modifying the device selection:

```python
# Example usage in training scripts
import torch_directml
device = torch_directml.device()  # Use AMD GPU
model = model.to(device)  # Move model to AMD GPU
```

Would you like me to show how to integrate DirectML support into your training scripts as well?

josshhz11: so this file, amd_gpu_configuration.py cannot check if we can select the gpu for training? it just shows us what the gpu device is and its specifications as well as direct ml support? how do we test if it can be selected for model training? during model training, when selected, does it have to be deselected after training?

GitHub Copilot: # Testing AMD GPU for Model Training

You're right. Let's create a small test script to verify if the AMD GPU can be used for actual model training:

```python
import torch
import torch_directml
import time
import numpy as np
from torch import nn

class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer = nn.Linear(1000, 1000)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.layer(x)

def test_gpu_training():
    print("=== GPU Training Test ===")
    
    # Create test data
    print("Creating test data...")
    x = torch.randn(1000, 1000)
    y = torch.randn(1000, 1000)
    
    # Initialize model
    model = SimpleModel()
    optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    criterion = nn.MSELoss()
    
    # Test on CPU first
    print("\nTesting on CPU...")
    start_time = time.time()
    model.to('cpu')
    x_cpu, y_cpu = x.to('cpu'), y.to('cpu')
    
    for _ in range(100):
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        output = model(x_cpu)
        loss = criterion(output, y_cpu)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    
    cpu_time = time.time() - start_time
    print(f"CPU Training Time: {cpu_time:.2f} seconds")
    
    # Test on DirectML device
    try:
        print("\nTesting on DirectML (AMD GPU)...")
        device = torch_directml.device()
        model.to(device)
        x_gpu, y_gpu = x.to(device), y.to(device)
        
        start_time = time.time()
        for _ in range(100):
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            output = model(x_gpu)

        print(f"DirectML Training Time: {gpu_time:.2f} seconds")
        
        # Calculate speedup
        speedup = cpu_time / gpu_time
        print(f"\nGPU Speedup: {speedup:.2f}x")
        
        # Memory usage
        print("\nMemory Usage:")
        print(f"GPU Tensor Memory: {torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated() / 1e6:.2f} MB")
        
        # Verify computation accuracy
        cpu_output = model.to('cpu')(x_cpu)
        gpu_output = model.to(device)(x_gpu).to('cpu')
        output_diff = torch.abs(cpu_output - gpu_output).mean().item()
        print(f"\nOutput Difference (CPU vs GPU): {output_diff:.6f}")
        
        return True
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\n‚ùå GPU Test Failed: {str(e)}")
        return False
    finally:
        # Cleanup
        print("\nCleaning up...")
        if torch.cuda.is_available():
            torch.cuda.empty_cache()
        model.to('cpu')
        del x_gpu, y_gpu
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    success = test_gpu_training()
    print(f"\nGPU Training Test {'Passed ‚úÖ' if success else 'Failed ‚ùå'}")
```

And update your sentiment training script to properly handle GPU selection and cleanup:

```python
# Move the device configuration after model initialization
def train_sentiment_model():
    try:
        # Initialize device
        device = torch_directml.device()
        print(f"Training on device: {device}")
        
        # Load model
        model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
        model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
            model_name, 
            num_labels=1
        ).to(device)  # Move model to GPU
        
        # ...existing code...
        
        # Update training arguments for GPU
        training_args = TrainingArguments(
            output_dir="./results",
            num_train_epochs=3,
            per_device_train_batch_size=8,
            per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
            warmup_steps=500,
            weight_decay=0.01,
            logging_dir='./logs',
            logging_steps=10,
            no_cuda=True,  # Required for DirectML
        )
        
        # ...existing code...
        
    finally:
        # Cleanup
        print("Cleaning up GPU memory...")
        model.to('cpu')
        if torch.cuda.is_available():
            torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

Key points:
1. The test script will benchmark CPU vs GPU performance
2. GPU selection happens when you move the model with `.to(device)`
3. Always clean up GPU memory in the `finally` block
4. The model automatically uses the device it's on - no need to deselect during training
5. Memory is freed when you move the model back to CPU or when the script ends

Run the test:
```bash
python test_gpu_training.py
```

This will tell you if your AMD GPU can be effectively used for training and show the performance difference compared to CPU.

when testing the gpu for the test dataset, it shows the output above. does it mean that it works? also, the time taken is longer in the gpu, is this normal? or would it get better than the cpu for large datasets?

and how do we configure this for sentiment_analysis_model_training.py?

GitHub Copilot: Let me explain the results and help with the configuration:

### Understanding Test Results
1. **GPU Detection**: Successfully detected your AMD GPU and DirectML support
2. **Performance Results**:
   - CPU: 2.30 seconds
   - GPU: 5.67 seconds
   - Speedup: 0.41x (GPU is actually slower)

This is normal for small datasets because:
1. Data transfer overhead between CPU and GPU
2. GPU initialization time
3. Small dataset doesn't leverage GPU parallelization

GPUs typically show better performance with:
- Larger batch sizes
- More complex models
- Larger datasets
- Longer training runs

### Configuring sentiment_analysis_model_training.py

Here's how to properly configure your sentiment analysis training:

```python
import torch_directml
import pandas as pd
from transformers import (
    AutoModelForSequenceClassification,
    AutoTokenizer,
    TrainingArguments,
    Trainer
)
from datasets import Dataset
import torch
import sqlite3
import os

def train_sentiment_model():
    try:
        # Initialize device
        device = torch_directml.device()
        print(f"üîß Initializing with device: {device}")
        
        # Load model
        print("üìö Loading BERT model...")
        model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
        model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
            model_name, 
            num_labels=1  # Regression task
        ).to(device)  # Move model to GPU
        
        tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
        
        # Prepare dataset
        print("üîÑ Preparing dataset...")
        dataset = prepare_dataset()
        
        # Tokenize with larger batch size for GPU
        def tokenize_function(examples):
            return tokenizer(
                examples["response_text"],
                padding="max_length",
                truncation=True,
                max_length=128,
                return_tensors="pt",  # Return PyTorch tensors
            )
        
        print("üî§ Tokenizing datasets...")
        tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(
            tokenize_function, 
            batched=True,
            batch_size=32  # Larger batch size for GPU
        )
        
        # Configure training arguments for GPU
        print("‚öôÔ∏è Configuring training arguments...")
        training_args = TrainingArguments(
            output_dir="./results",
            num_train_epochs=3,
            per_device_train_batch_size=16,  # Increased for GPU
            per_device_eval_batch_size=16,   # Increased for GPU
            warmup_steps=500,
            weight_decay=0.01,
            logging_dir='./logs',
            logging_steps=10,
            no_cuda=True,  # Required for DirectML
            fp16=True,     # Use mixed precision
            gradient_accumulation_steps=2,  # Accumulate gradients
        )
        
        # Initialize Trainer
        print("üöÄ Initializing trainer...")
        trainer = Trainer(
            model=model,
            args=training_args,
            train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
            eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["test"],
        )
        
        # Train model
        print("üìà Starting training...")
        trainer.train()
        
        # Save model
        print("üíæ Saving model...")
        trainer.save_model("./sentiment_model")
        tokenizer.save_pretrained("./sentiment_model")
        
        print("‚úÖ Training completed successfully!")
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Training failed: {str(e)}")
        raise
    finally:
        # Cleanup
        print("üßπ Cleaning up GPU memory...")
        if hasattr(model, 'to'):
            model.to('cpu')
        torch.cuda.empty_cache()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("=== Sentiment Analysis Model Training ===")
    train_sentiment_model()
```

Key optimizations made:
1. Increased batch sizes for GPU
2. Added mixed precision training (`fp16=True`)
3. Added gradient accumulation
4. Proper memory cleanup
5. Progress indicators
6. Error handling

### To monitor GPU performance during training:

```python
# Add this function to sentiment_analysis_model_training.py
def print_gpu_utilization():
    try:
        import psutil
        process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
        print(f"\nMemory Usage: {process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
        print(f"GPU Memory: {torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated() / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
    except:
        pass
```

Call this function periodically during training to monitor resource usage.

For better performance:
1. Try different batch sizes (16, 32, 64)
2. Adjust `gradient_accumulation_steps`
3. Monitor memory usage
4. Consider using a smaller model if memory is constrained

Would you like me to provide additional monitoring tools or performance optimization techniques?

josshhz11: where should we call this function in the train_sentiment_model()?

also, can we add a function to load the model afterwards, and evaluate the model on key metrics like precision, recall, accuracy, etc. and also other stuff like MSE perhaps?

GitHub Copilot: Let's modify the code to add GPU monitoring and model evaluation:

1. First, let's add GPU monitoring calls in strategic places:

```python
def train_sentiment_model():
    try:
        # ...existing initialization code...
        
        print("üìà Starting training...")
        print_gpu_utilization()  # Before training
        trainer.train()
        print_gpu_utilization()  # After training
        
        print("üíæ Saving model...")
        print_gpu_utilization()  # Before saving
        trainer.save_model("./sentiment_model")
        tokenizer.save_pretrained("./sentiment_model")
        print_gpu_utilization()  # After saving
```

2. Now let's add model evaluation functions:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, accuracy_score, precision_recall_fscore_support
import numpy as np

def evaluate_model(model_path="./sentiment_model"):
    try:
        print("\n=== Model Evaluation ===")
        
        # Load model and tokenizer
        device = torch_directml.device()
        model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_path).to(device)
        tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
        
        # Prepare test dataset
        dataset = prepare_dataset()
        test_dataset = dataset['test']
        
        # Tokenize test data
        encoded_dataset = tokenizer(
            test_dataset['response_text'],
            padding=True,
            truncation=True,
            return_tensors="pt"
        ).to(device)
        
        # Get predictions
        with torch.no_grad():
            outputs = model(**encoded_dataset)
            predictions = outputs.logits.cpu().numpy()
        
        # Get actual values
        actual_scores = test_dataset['sentiment_score']
        
        # Calculate metrics
        mse = mean_squared_error(actual_scores, predictions)
        rmse = np.sqrt(mse)
        
        # Convert to binary classification for precision/recall
        # Assuming sentiment scores > 50 are positive
        binary_actual = [1 if score > 50 else 0 for score in actual_scores]
        binary_pred = [1 if pred > 50 else 0 for pred in predictions]
        
        precision, recall, f1, _ = precision_recall_fscore_support(
            binary_actual, 
            binary_pred, 
            average='binary'
        )
        accuracy = accuracy_score(binary_actual, binary_pred)
        
        # Print results
        print("\nüìä Model Metrics:")
        print(f"MSE: {mse:.4f}")
        print(f"RMSE: {rmse:.4f}")
        print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
        print(f"Precision: {precision:.4f}")
        print(f"Recall: {recall:.4f}")
        print(f"F1 Score: {f1:.4f}")
        
        return {
            'mse': mse,
            'rmse': rmse,
            'accuracy': accuracy,
            'precision': precision,
            'recall': recall,
            'f1': f1
        }
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Evaluation failed: {str(e)}")
        return None
    finally:
        if 'model' in locals():
            model.to('cpu')
        torch.cuda.empty_cache()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("=== Sentiment Analysis Model Training ===")
    train_sentiment_model()
    print("\n=== Model Evaluation ===")
    metrics = evaluate_model()
```

3. Also add a utility function to load and use the model for predictions:

```python
def load_model_for_prediction(model_path="./sentiment_model"):
    device = torch_directml.device()
    model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_path).to(device)
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
    
    def predict_sentiment(text):
        # Tokenize input
        inputs = tokenizer(
            text,
            padding=True,
            truncation=True,
            return_tensors="pt"
        ).to(device)
        
        # Get prediction
        with torch.no_grad():
            outputs = model(**inputs)
            prediction = outputs.logits.cpu().numpy()[0][0]
        
        return prediction
    
    return predict_sentiment

# Example usage:
# predict = load_model_for_prediction()
# sentiment = predict("I had a great day today!")
# print(f"Sentiment score: {sentiment}")
```

Add these new requirements to your requirements.txt:

```text
scikit-learn
numpy
```

The evaluation metrics will help you understand:
- MSE/RMSE: How close the predictions are to actual scores
- Accuracy: Overall correct predictions (binary classification)
- Precision: Accuracy of positive predictions
- Recall: Ability to find all positive cases
- F1: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

josshhz11: can we configure that i will save these models when trained to a folder called "models", and within it each model will be configured with sentiment_model_1 or 2 or 3... and this can be configured with a display menu that allows us to choose which actions we want to take, and takes in input which model to use and the corresponding model path. can you configure the functions such that we will name the model based on the model_num input? and also save it to models folder which has been created

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you modify the code to handle model organization better. Here's how to update the functions:

Key changes made:
1. Added `MODELS_DIR` constant for model storage
2. Created `get_model_path()` helper function
3. Updated `train_sentiment_model()` to use numbered paths
4. Added `list_available_models()` function
5. Enhanced menu system with model listing
6. Added interactive prediction mode
7. Improved error handling and user feedback
8. Added model selection for evaluation and prediction

The script will now:
- Create a models directory if it doesn't exist
- Save models with numbered names (e.g., `sentiment_model_1`)
- Show available models in the menu
- Allow easy model selection for evaluation and prediction
- Provide better user feedback and error handling

Would you like me to add any additional features to this menu system?

josshhz11: for the different cases in main, can we run these checks:
1. case 1: if the model num (and model path) already exists in models directory (check it), show erorr message of model already present
2. case 2: if model not present or doesn't exist, show error too

this is on top of the checks already run and not replacing them

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you add those additional checks. Here's the modified `main()` function with the new validation logic:

```python
def main():
    while True:
        choice = display_menu()

        match choice:
            case '1':
                model_num = input("Enter model number (e.g., 1, 2, 3): ")
                if not model_num.isdigit():
                    print("‚ùå Please enter a valid number")
                    continue
                
                # Check if model already exists
                model_path = get_model_path(model_num)
                if os.path.exists(model_path):
                    print(f"‚ùå Model {model_num} already exists at {model_path}")

            # ...rest of the cases remain unchanged...
```

Changes made:
1. Case 1 (Train Model):
   - Added check for existing model directory
   - Prevents overwriting existing models
   - Provides clear error message with path

2. Case 2 (Evaluate Model):
   - Added check for model directory existence
   - Added check for model configuration file
   - More detailed error messages
   - Better validation of model integrity

Key features:
- Prevents accidental model overwriting
- Ensures model files are complete before evaluation
- Clear error messages with specific paths
- Maintains existing input validation

Would you like me to add similar checks to the other cases as well?

josshhz11: now back to the generate_dataset.py file, for the query_db() function can i add on within it or create a new function to delete specific id/ids for responses?

for instance, under the responses table, i wish to have a function that allows me to first connect to the db, choose which table i wish to delete from and allow me to input an id, or a list of ids, where it will iterate through and delete all entries with the response_ids in the list

GitHub Copilot: Here's how to add a delete function to your query system:

```python
def delete_entries():
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect('mental_health_data.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        print("\nüóëÔ∏è Delete Database Entries")
        print("1. Delete from responses table")
        print("2. Delete from questions table")
        print("3. Back to main menu")

        table_choice = input("\nSelect table: ")
        
        if table_choice not in ['1', '2']:
            return

        table_name = 'responses' if table_choice == '1' else 'questions'
        id_column = 'response_id' if table_choice == '1' else 'question_id'

        # Show current entries
        df = pd.read_sql_query(f"SELECT * FROM {table_name}", conn)
        print(f"\nCurrent {table_name}:")
        print(df)

        # Get IDs to delete
        print("\nEnter IDs to delete (comma-separated, e.g., '1,2,3' or single ID):")
        ids_input = input().strip()
        
        try:
            # Convert input to list of integers
            ids_to_delete = [int(id.strip()) for id in ids_input.split(',')]
            
            # Confirm deletion
            print(f"\nYou are about to delete {len(ids_to_delete)} entries with IDs: {ids_to_delete}")
            confirm = input("Are you sure? (y/n): ")
            
            if confirm.lower() == 'y':
                # Convert list to tuple for SQL IN clause
                ids_tuple = tuple(ids_to_delete)
                
                if len(ids_tuple) == 1:
                    # Special case for single ID
                    cursor.execute(f"DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE {id_column} = ?", (ids_tuple[0],))
                else:
                    cursor.execute(f"DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE {id_column} IN {ids_tuple}")
                
                conn.commit()
                print(f"‚úÖ Successfully deleted {cursor.rowcount} entries")
                
                # Show updated entries
                df = pd.read_sql_query(f"SELECT * FROM {table_name}", conn)
                print(f"\nUpdated {table_name}:")
                print(df)
            else:
                print("Deletion cancelled")
                
        except ValueError:
            print("‚ùå Invalid ID format. Please enter numbers separated by commas")
        except sqlite3.Error as e:
            print(f"‚ùå Database error: {e}")
            conn.rollback()
            
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Database error: {e}")
    finally:
        conn.close()

# Update query_db() to include the delete option
def query_db():
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect('mental_health_data.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        while True:
            print("\nüìä Database Query Options:")
            print("1. View all questions")
            print("2. View responses for a specific question")
            print("3. View responses by sentiment range")
            print("4. View summary statistics")
            print("5. Custom SQL query")
            print("6. Delete entries")  # New option
            print("7. Exit")
            
            choice = input("\nEnter your choice (1-7): ")

            match(choice):
                # ... existing cases ...
                case '6':
                    delete_entries()
                case '7':
                    print("Exiting query tool...")
                    break
                case _:
                    print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```

Features of the delete function:
1. Choose table to delete from (responses or questions)
2. Shows current entries before deletion
3. Accepts comma-separated IDs
4. Confirmation prompt before deletion
5. Shows updated entries after deletion
6. Error handling for:
   - Invalid ID format
   - Database errors
   - SQL constraints
7. Transaction rollback on error

To use:
1. Select "Query Database" from main menu
2. Choose "Delete entries" option
3. Select table
4. Enter IDs to delete
5. Confirm deletion

Would you like me to add any additional features to the delete function?

josshhz11: some follow-ups:
1. can we then update the questions.csv and responses.csv for whichever table deletions were made? you can overwrite the responses.csv and not need to create a new one.

2. also whenever the responses are generated in generate_responses(), the responses are added to the database and not a new one is being generated right? can we configure it that way, to check if database exists, and if it doesn't initialize it. if it does, just select it. and if responses are being generated, we add on the responses to what's already existing in the database?

3. and also can we include a parameter for the generate_responses() function to take input from users, the number of responses to generate for each question? for now just have one num of responses input for all questions.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help with all three modifications:

1. First, let's update the `delete_db_entries()` function to refresh CSV files after deletion:

```python
def update_csv_files(conn):
    """Update CSV files with current database content"""
    print("\nüìä Updating CSV files...")
    
    # Export questions
    questions_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM questions", conn)
    questions_df.to_csv('questions.csv', index=False)
    
    # Export responses
    responses_df = pd.read_sql_query("""
        SELECT r.response_id, q.question_text, r.response_text, r.sentiment_score
        FROM responses r 
        JOIN questions q ON r.question_id = q.question_id
    """, conn)
    responses_df.to_csv('responses.csv', index=False)
    print("‚úÖ CSV files updated successfully!")
```

2. Modify the `generate_responses()` function to handle existing database:

```python
def generate_responses(num_responses=50):
    print("üöÄ Starting response generation process...")
    
    # Check if database exists
    db_exists = os.path.exists('mental_health_data.db')
    
    if not db_exists:
        print("üìÅ Database not found. Initializing new database...")
        if not initialize_db():
            return
    
    # Connect to database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('mental_health_data.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Read refined questions from file
    print("üìñ Reading refined questions from file...")
    with open('refined_questions.txt', 'r') as f:
        questions = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines() if line.strip()]
    
    # Check which questions are new
    existing_questions = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT question_text FROM questions", conn)
    new_questions = [q for q in questions if q not in existing_questions['question_text'].values]
    
    if new_questions:
        print(f"üìù Inserting {len(new_questions)} new questions into database...")
        for question in new_questions:
            cursor.execute('INSERT INTO questions (question_text) VALUES (?)', (question,))
    
    # Get all question IDs
    question_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT question_id, question_text FROM questions", conn)
    
    # Generate responses using LLM
    print(f"ü§ñ Generating {num_responses} sample responses per question...")
    
    response_prompt = """You are a mental health patient who has been discharged from care. 
    Generate a realistic, varied response to this follow-up question. 
    The response should reflect different possible mental states and situations.
    Mix positive, neutral, and negative responses to create a diverse dataset.
    Keep responses between 1-3 sentences.

    Question: {question}

    Generate a single response:"""
    
    chat_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template=response_prompt)
    chain = chat_prompt | model
    
    # Generate responses for each question
    for _, row in question_df.iterrows():
        question_id = row['question_id']
        question = row['question_text']
        print(f"\nüí≠ Generating responses for question {question_id}: {question}")
        
        for i in range(num_responses):
            if i % 10 == 0:
                print(f"Progress: {i}/{num_responses} responses")
            
            response = chain.invoke({"question": question})
            
            # Insert response into database
            cursor.execute('''
                INSERT INTO responses (question_id, response_text)
                VALUES (?, ?)
            ''', (question_id, response.strip()))
    
    # Commit changes
    conn.commit()
    
    # Update CSV files
    update_csv_files(conn)
    
    conn.close()
    
    print("\n‚úÖ Process completed successfully!")
    print(f"üìä Generated {len(question_df) * num_responses} total new responses")
```

3. Update the main menu to handle the number of responses:

```python
def main():
    while True:
        choice = display_menu()

        match choice:
            case '1':
                generate_refined_questions()
            case '2':
                try:
                    num_responses = int(input("Enter number of responses to generate per question: "))
                    if num_responses <= 0:
                        print("‚ùå Please enter a positive number")
                        continue
                    generate_responses(num_responses)
                except ValueError:
                    print("‚ùå Please enter a valid number")
            case '3':
                query_db()
            case '4':
                label_sentiments()
            case '0':
                print("Exiting...")
                sys.exit()
            case _:
                print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```

These changes will:
1. Automatically update CSV files after deletions
2. Handle existing databases properly
3. Allow custom number of responses per question
4. Preserve existing data when generating new responses
5. Show clear progress indicators
6. Provide better error handling

Would you like me to explain any part of these changes in more detail?

josshhz11: can we update the query_db() function to include the question (and response_id for response table) with each response that is printed out? can just be something like: Question ID: {question_id}, Response ID: {response_id}, Score: {score}

and the response below it


GitHub Copilot: I'll help modify the `query_db()` function to include more detailed information. Here are the changes needed:

```python
# Update cases 2 and 3 in the query_db() function:

                case '2':
                    question_id = input("\nEnter question ID: ")

                        JOIN questions q ON r.question_id = q.question_id
                        WHERE q.question_id = ?
                        ORDER BY r.sentiment_score DESC
                    """, conn, params=[question_id])

                        print("\nResponses:")
                        for _, row in responses_df.iterrows():
                            sentiment = row['sentiment_score'] if pd.notna(row['sentiment_score']) else 'Not labeled'
                            print(f"Question ID: {row['question_id']}, Response ID: {row['response_id']}, Score: {sentiment}")
                            print(f"Question: {row['question_text']}")
                            print(f"Response: {row['response_text']}")
                            print("-" * 50)

                case '3':
                    min_score = input("Enter minimum sentiment score (1-100): ")
                    max_score = input("Enter maximum sentiment score (1-100): ")
                    
                    responses_df = pd.read_sql_query("""
                        SELECT r.response_id, q.question_id, q.question_text, r.response_text, r.sentiment_score

                        JOIN questions q ON r.question_id = q.question_id
                        WHERE r.sentiment_score BETWEEN ? AND ?

                    """, conn, params=[min_score, max_score])

                        print("-" * 50)
```

Changes made:
1. Added `question_id` and `response_id` to SQL queries
2. Updated print format to show IDs and scores on one line
3. Separated question and response text for better readability
4. Maintained consistent formatting across both cases

josshhz11: # Read refined questions from file
    print("üìñ Reading refined questions from file...")
    with open('refined_questions.txt', 'r') as f:

    # Get all question IDs
    question_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT question_id, question_text FROM questions", conn)

    for this part, does it check the refined_questions.txt file, and only add the questions to the database if they are not already there?

GitHub Copilot: Let's analyze this section of code. There's actually a logic issue here - it's inserting all questions first and then checking for new ones, which could lead to duplicate entries. Here's how to fix it:

```python
    # Read refined questions from file
    print("üìñ Reading refined questions from file...")
    with open('refined_questions.txt', 'r') as f:
        questions = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines() if line.strip()]

    # Get existing questions from database
    print("üîç Checking for existing questions...")
    existing_questions = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT question_text FROM questions", conn)
    existing_question_texts = existing_questions['question_text'].values
    
    # Find new questions
    new_questions = [q for q in questions if q not in existing_question_texts]
    
    if new_questions:
        print(f"üìù Inserting {len(new_questions)} new questions into database...")
        for question in new_questions:
            cursor.execute('INSERT INTO questions (question_text) VALUES (?)', (question,))
        conn.commit()
    else:
        print("‚úÖ No new questions to add")

    # Get all question IDs for further processing
    question_df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT question_id, question_text FROM questions", conn)
```

Key improvements:
1. Removes duplicate insertion of questions
2. Checks for existing questions before inserting
3. Only inserts truly new questions
4. Adds explicit commit after insertions
5. Better progress messages

The workflow is now:
1. Read questions from file
2. Get existing questions from database
3. Compare and find only new questions
4. Insert only the new questions
5. Get updated question list for further processing

josshhz11: so right now, i've deleted a couple of irrelevant responses from the database, does it automatically reflect and change the questions.csv and responses.csv files?

GitHub Copilot: No, looking at the code, the `update_csv_files()` function is only called in two places:
1. After generating responses in `generate_responses()`
2. After labeling sentiments in `label_sentiments()`

It's not called after deletions in `delete_db_entries()`. Let's fix this by adding the CSV update after successful deletions:

```python
def delete_db_entries():
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect('mental_health_data.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        
        # ...existing deletion code...
        
        if confirm.lower() == 'y':
            # ...existing deletion execution...
            
            conn.commit()
            print(f"‚úÖ Successfully deleted {cursor.rowcount} entries")
            
            # Update CSV files after successful deletion
            update_csv_files(conn)
            
            # Show updated entries
            df = pd.read_sql_query(f"SELECT * FROM {table_name}", conn)
            print(f"\nUpdated {table_name}:")
            print(df)
```

Now the CSV files will automatically update whenever you delete entries from the database. You can verify this by checking the CSV files after deletion.

josshhz11: how can i configure my amd gpu to run generate_dataset.py especially for generate_responses() function here in this file generate_dataset.py? it is used in sentiment_analysis_model_training.py

GitHub Copilot: To configure AMD GPU support for generate_dataset.py, particularly for the `generate_responses()` function, we'll need to modify the model initialization and configuration. Here's how to update your code:

```python
import torch_directml
from langchain_ollama import OllamaLLM

# Update model initialization at the top of the file
def initialize_model():
    try:
        # Configure GPU settings
        device = torch_directml.device()
        print(f"üîß Initializing model with device: {device}")
        
        model = OllamaLLM(

            num_gpu=1,
            f16_kv=True,   # Enable half-precision for better performance
            gpu_layers=35,  # Adjust based on available memory
        )
        
        print("‚úÖ Model initialized with GPU support")
        return model
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå GPU initialization failed: {e}")
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Falling back to CPU model")
        return OllamaLLM(model="llama3.2")

# Replace the direct model initialization with the function call
model = initialize_model()

# Update generate_responses function
def generate_responses(num_responses=50):
    print("üöÄ Starting response generation process...")
    
    try:
        # Print GPU information
        device = torch_directml.device()
        print(f"üìä Using device: {device}")
        
        # ...rest of your existing generate_responses code...
        
        # Update the response generation loop with progress monitoring
        for _, row in question_df.iterrows():
            question_id = row['question_id']
            question = row['question_text']
            print(f"\nüí≠ Generating responses for question {question_id}/{len(question_df)}: {question}")
            
            for i in range(num_responses):
                if i % 10 == 0:
                    print(f"Progress: {i}/{num_responses} responses")
                    print_gpu_utilization()  # Add GPU monitoring
                
                response = chain.invoke({"question": question})
                
                cursor.execute('''
                    INSERT INTO responses (question_id, response_text)
                    VALUES (?, ?)
                ''', (question_id, response.strip()))
                
                if i % 50 == 0:  # Commit every 50 responses
                    conn.commit()
    
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error during response generation: {e}")
        raise
    finally:
        # Cleanup
        print("üßπ Cleaning up resources...")
        torch.cuda.empty_cache()  # Clear GPU memory

# Add GPU utilization monitoring
def print_gpu_utilization():
    try:
        import psutil
        process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
        print(f"\nMemory Usage: {process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
        if torch.cuda.is_available():
            print(f"GPU Memory: {torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated() / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
    except:
        pass
```

Also, update your requirements.txt:

```text
torch-directml
psutil
langchain-ollama>=0.0.3
transformers
torch
```

Install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key changes made:
1. Added GPU initialization function
2. Configured Ollama for GPU usage
3. Added memory monitoring
4. Added proper cleanup
5. Added progress tracking
6. Added error handling

To test if GPU is being used:
1. Run the script
2. Monitor GPU utilization
3. Compare generation speeds

The GPU configuration should now be properly set up for both response generation and model training.

josshhz11: we are splitting the labelling work on the datasets and might label responses for each question (2, 3, 3), but we might label on the csv file directly. is there a way to push these labelled data onto the database and update it?

for instance, have the file read the responses.csv for the responses and corresponding sentiment score, and update accordingly using a for loop for all responses by their response id

GitHub Copilot: Yes, we can create a function to update the database from a modified CSV file. Here's how to do it:

```python
def update_db_from_csv():
    try:
        print("üîÑ Updating database from CSV...")
        conn = sqlite3.connect('mental_health_data.db')
        
        # Read the CSV file
        try:
            df = pd.read_csv('responses.csv')
            if 'response_id' not in df.columns or 'sentiment_score' not in df.columns:
                print("‚ùå CSV file must contain 'response_id' and 'sentiment_score' columns")
                return
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"‚ùå Error reading CSV: {e}")
            return

        # Update sentiment scores in database
        updated_count = 0
        error_count = 0
        
        print("üìä Updating sentiment scores...")
        for _, row in df.iterrows():
            if pd.notna(row['sentiment_score']):  # Only update if sentiment score exists
                try:
                    conn.execute('''
                        UPDATE responses 
                        SET sentiment_score = ? 
                        WHERE response_id = ?
                    ''', (int(row['sentiment_score']), row['response_id']))
                    updated_count += 1
                except Exception as e:
                    print(f"‚ùå Error updating response_id {row['response_id']}: {e}")
                    error_count += 1
            
            # Show progress every 50 records
            if updated_count % 50 == 0 and updated_count > 0:
                print(f"Progress: {updated_count} records updated...")
        
        conn.commit()
        print(f"\n‚úÖ Update complete!")
        print(f"üìä Statistics:")
        print(f"- Total records processed: {len(df)}")
        print(f"- Records updated: {updated_count}")
        print(f"- Errors: {error_count}")
        
        # Update CSV files to sync everything
        update_csv_files(conn)
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error: {e}")
    finally:
        conn.close()
```

Add this option to your menu system:

```python
def display_menu():
    print("\n=== Mental Health Question & Response Generator ===")
    print("1. Generate Refined Questions")
    print("2. Generate Responses")
    print("3. Query Database")
    print("4. Label Sentiments")
    print("5. Update DB from CSV")  # New option
    print("0. Exit")
    return input("\nSelect an option: ")

def main():
    while True:
        choice = display_menu()

        match choice:
            # ... existing cases ...
            case '5':
                update_db_from_csv()
            case '0':
                print("Exiting...")
                sys.exit()
            case _:
                print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```

Usage workflow:
1. Export current data to CSV
2. Split CSV among team members
3. Each person labels their portion
4. Combine labeled CSVs into one
5. Use "Update DB from CSV" option to sync back to database

The function will:
- Validate CSV format
- Only update rows with sentiment scores
- Show progress during update
- Provide statistics after completion
- Re-sync all CSV files after update

Would you like me to add any additional features to this update function?

josshhz11: once we have labelled our question and corresponding response data with a sentiment score, can we train an ML/AI/LLM model to predict sentiment scores of responses given a question, using NLP?

is the implementation on this page correct?

i wish to have the model inputs as the question, and the response, and have the output be the sentiment score. will this help the model train to predict scores?

also should we use a genAI model that is good at NLP instead? to follow in line with the hackathon outline that specifically asks for a GenAI implementation. any suggestions? models that can be obtained from huggingface trainer for training


GitHub Copilot: Let me help analyze and improve the sentiment analysis model for your use case:

1. **Current Implementation Analysis**:
- Your code uses BERT base model for regression
- Takes only response text as input
- Missing the question context
- Uses DirectML for AMD GPU support

2. **Suggested Improvements**:

```python
def prepare_dataset():
    """Modified to include both question and response"""
    conn = sqlite3.connect('mental_health_data.db')
    df = pd.read_sql_query("""
        SELECT q.question_text, r.response_text, r.sentiment_score
        FROM responses r
        JOIN questions q ON r.question_id = q.question_id
        WHERE r.sentiment_score IS NOT NULL
    """, conn)
    conn.close()
    
    dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(df)
    return dataset.train_test_split(test_size=0.2)

def tokenize_function(examples, tokenizer):
    """Modified to handle question-response pairs"""
    # Combine question and response with a separator
    combined_text = [
        f"Question: {q} Response: {r}" 
        for q, r in zip(examples["question_text"], examples["response_text"])
    ]
    
    return tokenizer(
        combined_text,
        padding="max_length",
        truncation=True,
        max_length=256,  # Increased for combined text
        return_tensors="pt"
    )
```

3. **Recommended GenAI Models**:
Here are better models for your task:

```python
# Choose one of these model configurations
MODEL_CONFIGS = {
    "flan-t5": {
        "name": "google/flan-t5-base",
        "type": "seq2seq"
    },
    "gpt2": {
        "name": "gpt2",
        "type": "causal"
    },
    "roberta": {
        "name": "roberta-base",
        "type": "masked"
    }
}

def train_sentiment_model(model_num, model_type="flan-t5"):
    config = MODEL_CONFIGS[model_type]
    model_name = config["name"]
```

4. **Why These Models**:
- **Flan-T5**: 
  - Better at understanding context
  - Good for question-answer tasks
  - Smaller size, easier to fine-tune
- **GPT-2**:
  - Strong text generation
  - Good context understanding
  - Natural language processing
- **RoBERTa**:
  - Improved BERT architecture
  - Better sentiment analysis
  - More robust training

5. **Training Configuration**:

```python
    training_args = TrainingArguments(
        output_dir=f"./results/model_{model_num}",
        num_train_epochs=5,
        per_device_train_batch_size=8,
        per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
        warmup_ratio=0.1,
        weight_decay=0.01,
        logging_dir=f'./logs/model_{model_num}',
        logging_steps=10,
        evaluation_strategy="epoch",
        save_strategy="epoch",
        load_best_model_at_end=True,
        metric_for_best_model="mse",
        no_cuda=True,  # For DirectML
        fp16=True
    )
```

6. **Recommended Changes**:
- Use Flan-T5 for better question-response understanding
- Increase context window to handle both question and response
- Add validation during training
- Use proper metrics for regression task
- Implement early stopping
- Save best model checkpoint

Would you like me to provide the complete updated implementation with these changes?

josshhz11: can you expand on flan-t5 and what it is? it's by google? and what kind of category of a model would you classify it as, compared to stuff like BERT/RoBERTa,  or even Mistral or Llama3.2, etc.

GitHub Copilot: Let me break down Flan-T5 and compare it with other models:

### Flan-T5 Overview
- **Origin**: Developed by Google Research
- **Base Architecture**: Built on T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)
- **Key Feature**: Instruction-tuned model, meaning it's specifically trained to follow natural language instructions

### Model Classification
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Language Models] --> B[Encoder-Decoder Models]
    A --> C[Encoder-Only Models]
    A --> D[Decoder-Only Models]
    
    B --> B1[T5/Flan-T5]
    B --> B2[BART]
    
    C --> C1[BERT]
    C --> C2[RoBERTa]
    
    D --> D1[GPT/Llama]
    D --> D2[Mistral]
```

### Model Comparisons

| Model | Architecture | Best For | Size Range | Training Approach |
|-------|-------------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Flan-T5 | Encoder-Decoder | Instruction following, Text-to-text tasks | 80M - 11B | Instruction tuning |
| BERT | Encoder-only | Understanding context, Classification | 110M - 340M | Masked language modeling |
| RoBERTa | Encoder-only | Better BERT, Classification | 125M - 355M | Dynamic masking |
| Llama 3.2 | Decoder-only | Generation, Chat | 7B - 70B | Autoregressive |
| Mistral | Decoder-only | Efficient generation | 7B | Mixture of experts |

### Why Flan-T5 for Your Task:
1. **Text-to-Text Framework**
   - Takes question + response as input
   - Outputs sentiment score naturally
   - More intuitive for regression tasks

2. **Advantages**:
```python
# Example of how Flan-T5 processes input
input_text = "Convert to sentiment score: Question: How are you feeling? Response: I'm feeling much better today!"
# Flan-T5 can directly output: "75"

# Compared to BERT which needs special tokens and fixed output format
bert_input = "[CLS] Question: How are you feeling? [SEP] Response: I'm feeling much better today! [SEP]"
# BERT outputs logits that need transformation
```

3. **Instruction Following**:
- Better understands the task through natural instructions
- More flexible in handling different input formats
- Can be prompted to explain its scoring

4. **Resource Requirements**:
- Smaller versions available (base: 250M parameters)
- More efficient than full Llama/Mistral
- Works well with DirectML on AMD GPUs

Would you like me to provide code examples for implementing Flan-T5 for your sentiment analysis task?

josshhz11: yes can you implement the entire code, referencing the requirements and structure of this current code which does it using BERT?

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you modify the code to use Flan-T5 instead of BERT, maintaining the same structure but optimizing for your question-response sentiment analysis task.

Key changes made:
1. Using Flan-T5 instead of BERT
2. Modified for sequence-to-sequence task
3. Combined question and response in input
4. Added proper data collation
5. Updated metrics computation
6. Modified prediction function

To use this, you'll need to update your requirements.txt:

```text
transformers>=4.30.0
torch
torch-directml
datasets
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
```

The main advantages of this implementation:
1. Better context understanding (questions + responses)
2. More natural sentiment score generation
3. Instruction-following capabilities
4. Better handling of text sequences

The existing menu system and utility functions can remain largely unchanged, just update the imports and model paths.

Would you like me to provide examples of how to use this model or explain any part in more detail?

josshhz11: can i ask if for this generate_dataset.py for the update_db_from_csv() function, i'm trying to put this code on my github, such that my groupmates can use the csv files of the data which are updated, to reconstruct the database itself and run the models from new_sentiment_model.py on their computer. can we create a new option in the display menu and main to construct the db from scratch from the csv files, either using initialize_db() or some elements of it as it is similar.

i was wondering if this was possible because the schema for responses.csv is a little different in that it contains the question itself and not the question_id as per the db schema

    print("3. Query Database")

            case '6':
                rebuild_db_from_csv()
            case '0':
                print("Exiting...")
                sys.exit()
            case _:
                print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")
```

Also, modify your [`initialize_db()`](../../../../../../../../../../../c:/Users/joshua/OneDrive/Documents/Working Folder/NTU/Extracurriculars/Case Comps/NUS-Guru SG Innovation Challenge/New/generate_dataset.py ) function to accept a parameter to drop existing tables:

```python
def initialize_db(drop_existing=False):
    """Initialize the SQLite database"""
    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect('mental_health_data.db')
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        
        # Drop tables if requested
        if drop_existing:
            print("‚ö†Ô∏è Dropping existing tables...")
            cursor.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS responses")
            cursor.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS questions")
        
        # Create questions table
        cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS questions (
            question_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            question_text TEXT NOT NULL
        )
        ''')
        
        # Create responses table
        cursor.execute('''
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS responses (
            response_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            question_id INTEGER,
            response_text TEXT NOT NULL,
            sentiment_score INTEGER,
            FOREIGN KEY (question_id) REFERENCES questions(question_id)
        )
        ''')
        
        conn.commit()
        conn.close()
        
        print("‚úÖ Database initialized successfully")
        return True
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error initializing database: {e}")
        return False
```

This implementation:
1. Creates a full database rebuild from CSV files
2. Preserves original IDs
3. Maps question text to question IDs
4. Creates a backup of any existing database
5. Handles potential format issues
6. Shows detailed progress and statistics

To use this:
1. Share both CSV files with your team
2. They clone the repository
3. They run the program and select option 6
4. The database is recreated with all data from the CSVs

josshhz11: then, currently with my own database, my team and i have finished labelling the sentiment scores of all responses in responses.csv. will running update_db_from_csv() from the display menu option 5 successfully update the db?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, running option 5 (`update_db_from_csv()`) will successfully update your database with all labeled sentiment scores from the responses.csv file.

Looking at your implementation, the function:

1. Reads the responses.csv file
2. Checks that it contains the required columns (`response_id` and `sentiment_score`)
3. Updates the database by running UPDATE queries for each row that has a sentiment score
4. Shows progress during the update
5. Provides statistics after completion
6. Re-syncs the CSV files with the database

Your team's workflow is perfect:
1. Team members labeled the responses in the CSV
2. You'll now run option 5 to update the database with those scores
3. The database will contain all labeled sentiment scores

Based on your responses.csv snippet, I can see you have:
- 141 responses with a range of sentiment scores between 15-95
- Good distribution across your sentiment range (1-100)
- Responses to different questions (question_text is included)

Simply select option 5 from the menu, and the function will handle the rest. The code will also give you statistics about how many records were updated and if there were any errors.
